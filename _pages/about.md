I'm a Master of Science in Statistics student at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/) supervised by the wonderful [Dr. Zeny Feng](https://mathstat.uoguelph.ca/people/feng). My research is on finite mixture models, particularly developing regularization methods for generalized linear regression mixture models. I completed my undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Guelph and a Technical Diploma in Biotechnology at [Mohawk College](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/).
